There is a lot of talk about ChatGPT conversations being indexed by Google, but is this really true? Let's take a closer look:

ChatGPT's shared links allow users to manually generate a URL that points to a static snapshot of a conversation. Misleading claims about alleged leaks of private content have appeared on social media and forums. This post debunks them from a technical standpoint.

The links follow the format https://chatgpt.com/share/, where the UUID is a random 128-bit identifier (32 hex characters). The option to prevent indexing by search engines is enabled by default and includes the tag:

The visible content includes user text, model responses, markdown, code blocks, links, and thumbnails if shared. Personal information, files, active execution, and access to history are not included.

In terms of security, the search space for a UUIDv4 is 2^128 combinations. Even at 1 million requests per second, it would take about 10^25 years to find a valid link at random. In addition, there are active measures such as rate limiting, scraping detection, and the ability to delete.

Indexing bots are also limited. ChatGPT's robots.txt file blocks most crawlers (Google-Extended, FacebookBot, Anthropic, etc.) and only allows access to specific paths. Even so, the HTML of shared links carries the noindex tag.

In summary: no exploration is possible, there is no default indexing, and no personal data is exposed. The “leaks” that are circulating are links that users themselves voluntarily shared on forums or networks. End of myth.
